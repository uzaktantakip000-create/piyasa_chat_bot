# NOTE: Worker HPA is REMOVED due to coordination issues
#
# Problem: StatefulSet workers require coordinated scaling with TOTAL_WORKERS
# When HPA scales workers (e.g., 4 → 12), TOTAL_WORKERS in ConfigMap stays static
# This breaks worker coordination logic (each worker must know total count)
#
# Solution: Scale workers MANUALLY by updating both:
#   1. StatefulSet replicas: kubectl scale statefulset/worker --replicas=8
#   2. ConfigMap TOTAL_WORKERS: Update and restart pods
#
# For automatic scaling, implement dynamic TOTAL_WORKERS discovery in code
# (e.g., query Kubernetes API for StatefulSet replica count)
#
# Worker HPA configuration removed (was: 4-12 replicas based on CPU 75% / Memory 85%)
